## Files Added (Not Modified)

### 1. `.gitignore` (NEW FILE)
**File**: `.gitignore`

**Changes Made**:
- Created a comprehensive Python-specific `.gitignore` file
- Added patterns to exclude:
  - Python cache and bytecode files (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `*.pyo`, etc.)
  - Virtual environment directories (`.venv/`, `venv/`, `ENV/`)
  - Python build/distribution files (`build/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`)
  - IDE configuration folders (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`)
  - OS-specific files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)
  - Temporary editor files (`*.swp`, `*.swo`)

**Reason**: To prevent tracking unnecessary files and keep the repository clean.
